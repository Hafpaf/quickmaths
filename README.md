# Quickmaths

A little game with the goal to calculate simpel math equations fast.

#### Run 'quickmaths.py' to try the program


## Explanation of the code

### The code includes these libaries:
- time
- numpy
- random

### Check if non integer and throw error if not
```python
try:
    number = int(input("Write something: ",))
except ValueError as e:
    print("NaN")
```


## TODO
- ~~Make small random math calculations~~
- Run again
- ~~Make different kind of questions~~
- ~~Catch non integer answers~~
- ~~Stop stupid users/testers~~
- Make more kind of questions
- Print to text file
- Run faster on 2nd try
